# Petstore — Full-Stack Demo

A complete, runnable full-stack application that shows the entire `@codewithagents` OpenAPI toolchain working together. One spec file drives a typed fetch client, React Query hooks, a server interface with Zod request validation, and end-to-end Playwright tests — all from a single source of truth.

> **Not published to npm.** This is a reference implementation. Clone the monorepo and run it locally.

> **Hono is this demo's choice, not a requirement.** The core of `openapi-server` is `service.ts` — a plain TypeScript interface with no framework imports. This petstore wires it to Hono because Hono is lightweight and runs anywhere, but you can implement the same interface against Express, Fastify, or any other server framework.

## What this demonstrates

| Layer | Technology | Generated from spec? |
|---|---|---|
| TypeScript types | `models.ts` | ✅ `openapi-zod-ts` |
| Fetch client | `client.ts` | ✅ `openapi-zod-ts` |
| React Query hooks | `hooks.ts` | ✅ `@codewithagents/openapi-react-query` |
| Server interface (framework-agnostic) | `service.ts` | ✅ `@codewithagents/openapi-server` |
| Router + Zod validation (Hono — demo choice) | `router.ts` | ✅ `@codewithagents/openapi-server` |
| Zod schemas | `schemas.ts` | ⚠️ Bootstrapped once, then **yours to own** |
| Business logic | `src/server/petService.ts` | ❌ You write this |
| React UI | `src/client/App.tsx` | ❌ You write this |

**The key insight:** everything in `generated/` is disposable. Change `spec/api.json`, run `pnpm generate`, and the types, client, hooks, and router update automatically. Your business logic in `src/` is untouched because it implements a stable TypeScript interface.

---

## Quick start

**Prerequisites:** Node.js ≥ 22, pnpm ≥ 10

**1. Clone the monorepo and install dependencies:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codewithagents/openapi-zod-ts.git
cd openapi-zod-ts
pnpm install
```

**2. Build the generator packages:**

```bash
pnpm build
```

**3. Start the petstore in dev mode:**

```bash
cd packages/petstore-hono
pnpm dev
```

This starts two servers concurrently:
- **Vite** on `http://localhost:5173` — React frontend with hot reload
- **Hono** on `http://localhost:3001` — API server (Vite proxies `/api` requests to it)

Open `http://localhost:5173` and you'll see a pet management UI. Add a pet, delete a pet — the full round-trip is live.

---

## The Zod validation story

This is the part that ties everything together. Open `generated/schemas.ts`:

```ts
// Bootstrapped by openapi-zod-ts — this file is yours. Never overwritten.
import { z } from 'zod'

export const PetSchema = z.object({
  id: z.string(),
  name: z.string(),
  species: z.string(),
}).passthrough()

export const CreatePetRequestSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string().min(1, 'Name is required'),
  species: z.string().min(1, 'Species is required'),
})
```

The `.min(1, ...)` rules are custom — they weren't in the spec. This is business logic you own.

Now look at the generated `router.ts`:

```ts
app.post('/pets', async (c) => {
  const body = await c.req.json()
  const parseResult = CreatePetRequestSchema.safeParse(body)
  if (!parseResult.success) {
    return c.json({ error: 'Invalid request body', issues: parseResult.error.issues }, 422)
  }
  return c.json(await service.createPet(parseResult.data), 201)
})
```

The router was regenerated (second pass) because `openapi-server.config.json` points at `input_schema: "generated/schemas.ts"`. The generator found `CreatePetRequestSchema`, wired it into the route, and now invalid requests return a structured `422` before they ever reach your service implementation.

**The full round-trip:**
```
Browser form submit
  → POST /api/pets { name: "", species: "Dog" }
  → Hono router → CreatePetRequestSchema.safeParse()
  → 422 { error: "Invalid request body", issues: [{ path: ["name"], message: "Name is required" }] }
  → React renders the error message next to the name field
```

## Regenerating from spec

When you change `spec/api.json`, regenerate all output files:

```bash
pnpm generate
```

This runs all three generators in order:
1. `openapi-zod-ts` → `models.ts`, `client.ts`, `client-config.ts`, `index.ts`
2. `openapi-server` → `service.ts`, `router.ts` (with Zod validation wired in)
3. `openapi-react-query` → `hooks.ts`, `test-utils.ts`

**`generated/schemas.ts` is never overwritten.** It's bootstrapped on the very first run (if it doesn't exist), then left entirely to you. Add validation rules, refinements, and business logic freely.

---

## Running E2E tests

The Playwright suite covers the complete browser-to-server round-trip:

```bash
pnpm test:e2e
```

This builds the React app with Vite, starts the Hono server, and runs 5 Playwright tests in Chromium:

1. Shows an empty state on first load
2. Can add a pet and see it in the list
3. Can delete a pet
4. Can add multiple pets
5. Form clears after adding a pet

Each test resets server state via `DELETE /api/pets` before running — tests are fully isolated.

**These tests also run in CI** as a separate parallel job (`E2E (Petstore)`) alongside the standard `Build, Lint & Test` job.

---

## Using this as a template for your own project

The petstore is deliberately simple so the structure is easy to copy. Here's how to adapt it:

**1. Replace the spec:**

```bash
cp your-api.json spec/api.json
```

**2. Regenerate:**

```bash
pnpm generate
```

The generator will bootstrap a fresh `generated/schemas.ts` if it doesn't exist yet. All other generated files are overwritten.

**3. Implement the service interface:**

Open `generated/service.ts` — it now reflects your spec. Create a file that satisfies the interface:

```ts
// src/server/myService.ts
import type { YourApiService } from '../generated/service.js'

export const myService: YourApiService = {
  async listItems(params) { ... },
  async createItem(body) { ... },
}
```

TypeScript will tell you at compile time if your implementation drifts from the spec.

**4. Wire it up:**

```ts
// src/server/index.ts
import { createRouter } from '../generated/router.js'
import { myService } from './myService.js'

const apiRouter = createRouter(myService)
app.route('/api', apiRouter)
```

**5. Use the hooks in React:**

```tsx
import { useListItems, useCreateItem } from '../generated/hooks.js'

function ItemList() {
  const { data } = useListItems()
  const create = useCreateItem()
  ...
}
```

## File structure

```
spec/
  api.json                    OpenAPI 3.1 — single source of truth

generated/                    Auto-generated — safe to delete and re-run
  models.ts                   TypeScript types (Pet, CreatePetRequest)
  client.ts                   Typed fetch functions (zero runtime deps)
  client-config.ts            configureClient() — base URL + auth setup
  index.ts                    Barrel re-export
  service.ts                  PetstoreService interface
  router.ts                   createRouter(service) — Hono routes + Zod validation
  hooks.ts                    useListPets, useCreatePet, useDeletePet (React Query)
  test-utils.ts               MSW handlers for testing hooks
  schemas.ts                  ⚠️ User-owned — bootstrapped once, never overwritten

src/
  server/
    petService.ts             Implements PetstoreService (in-memory Map)
    index.ts                  Hono app — mounts router, serves React build
  client/
    App.tsx                   React UI — uses generated hooks

e2e/
  pets.spec.ts                Playwright tests (browser → Hono → Zod → React)

openapi-zod-ts.config.json       Generator config (client-side files)
openapi-server.config.json    Generator config (server files + Zod validation)
openapi-react-query.config.json  Generator config (React Query hooks)
```

## Generator configs

**`openapi-zod-ts.config.json`**
```json
{
  "input_openapi": "spec/api.json",
  "output": "generated/",
  "input_schema": "generated/schemas.ts"
}
```

**`openapi-server.config.json`**
```json
{
  "input_openapi": "spec/api.json",
  "output": "generated/",
  "framework": "hono",
  "input_schema": "generated/schemas.ts"
}
```

**`openapi-react-query.config.json`**
```json
{
  "input_openapi": "spec/api.json",
  "output": "generated/"
}
```

All three share the same spec and output directory. The `input_schema` points both `openapi-zod-ts` and `openapi-server` at the same `schemas.ts`, so client-side and server-side validation use identical rules.
